Build Instructions for Android-API:

1.Verify that you have the latest JDK (you might need to set the JDK_HOME variable)
2.Clone the latest iotivity codebase.
3.set environment variables:
    a.platform=android
    b.If running in windows, change the following line in the build.gradle file (<iotivity>/android/android_api/base/build.gradle):
        def ndkBuild = new File(System.env.ANDROID_NDK_HOME, 'ndk-build')
            to
        def ndkBuild = new File(System.env.ANDROID_NDK_HOME, 'ndk-build.cmd')

4.Build scons for android and your targeted architecture (This will also build Android API):
    a.scons TARGET_OS=android TARGET_ARCH=<target arch> TARGET_TRANSPORT=IP RELEASE=1 
               where <target arch> can be armeabi, armeabi-v7a, x86.
               Note: To build in debug mode, use RELEASE=0.
               Note: The minimum SDK version supported is 21.
               Note: Only TARGET_TRANSPORT currently supported is IP
    b.If the project is setup correctly, you should see a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message on the terminal
    c.You should see the .aar files generated inside of '<iotivity>/android/android_api/base/build/outputs/aar' directory. The .aar files contain jni directory and also a .jar file


TO RUN UNIT TESTS IN ANDROID-API

5.The '<iotivity>/android/android_api/base/src/androidTest/...' directory contains tests which can be used to get an idea about the Android API usage.


TO USE THE .AAR FILE IN <iotivity>/android/examples project

6. Verify that 7 different *.so files exist inside <iotivity>/android/android-api/base/libs/<TARGET_ARCH> directory. (They should already be present in the *.aar file.)
7. Import Project 'Examples' into android-studio.
8.To add an .aar file to the 'Examples' project,
   a.Right click on Examples->New->Module->Import .JAR or .AAR Package
   b.Select the .aar file from the location in step 6e above
   c.Right click on Examples->Open Module Settings
   d.Select each sample app module under 'Modules'->Dependencies->Add->Module Dependency
   e.The .aar file selected in step 10b above should be present. Select it.
   f.Repeat steps d and e for each sample app module.


TO USE THE .AAR FILE IN A DIFFERENT PROJECT

9. Verify that 7 different *.so files exist inside <iotivity base>/android/android-api/base/libs/<TARGET_ARCH> directory.
10. Import the .aar file in your project to use it
